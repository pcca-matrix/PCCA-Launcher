# PCCA Launcher Alpha 0.11

**PCCA Launcher** is a program and emulator launcher for **Windows 10/11**, written in **Python / PyQt**.  
It is designed to provide a rich, immersive, and fully customizable user experience.

## Launcher Compatibility

This launcher is designed primarily to be used with **Attract-Mode** and the **PCCA theme**.  

However, it can also be used with other Attract-Mode themes or even with different frontends.  

Its flexibility allows integration beyond the original intended setup.

  - In-game access via the pause menu  
- Per-emulator and per-ROM configuration for fully tailored behavior  
- Customizable pre-launch screens with selectable options before starting the emulator 
- Support for user-defined scripts written in Python, with callbacks that let users control emulator options or send key sequences directly to emulator windows  
- Integration with input mapping tools such as Joy2Key  
- Emualtor volume control 
- Fully configurable fade-in and fade-out transitions, including:
  - Smooth animations  
  - On-screen text display

## Planned Features

- High score tracking for arcade games  

## Alpha Version Notice

This launcher is currently in **alpha** stage. It is still under active development, so:

- Documentation is incomplete.
- Bugs and unexpected issues are likely to occur.

The source code is **not publicly available** yet because the project is built with Python and PyQt.  
Distributing the raw code would require users to compile the application into an executable themselves, which is inconvenient for most users.  

A graphical user interface (GUI) **may be developed later** if there is enough need.

Once the launcher is stable and fully functional, the source code will be published for public access.

Thank you for your understanding.
